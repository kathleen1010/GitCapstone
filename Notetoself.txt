search for grams
do one search with the operator that takes 
"this char, up to this many times" 
I think it's like \w{1-3}{target}
see Re documentation..
want the greedy version.
FIRST collect only the pre- target grams
THEN For each gram collected, 
if len(gram) - len(target)=2
    re-add to the list gram[1:] 
if len(gram) - len(target)=3
    re- add to the list gram[2:]
and so on. 

we're going up to 4 on all things because
my domain knowledge is that Chinese expressions
come in 4s, especially idioms.  

we are making a Set. 
then do the same thing on the other side. 
collect post target grams, greedy.
then shorten long grams.
